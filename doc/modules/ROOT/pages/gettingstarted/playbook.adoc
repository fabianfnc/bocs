=== UI-Bundle

Anotra needs a UI Bundle to build your html page.

I already have created a simple https://github.com/fabianfnc/bocs/blob/master/doc/uibundle.zip[UI-Bundle icon:external link[]] that you can use.

NOTE: If you want to adjust your UI just download it, make your changes, save it as a zip file and push it to your Repository
