== Existing Controllers

=== Api Backend Controller

Establishes the connection to OpenEMS Backend.

=== Api REST/JSON Controller

Provides a REST-Api for external access to OpenEMS Edge. The default port for the server is *8084*; so the default base address for REST calls is `http://x:<PASSWORD>@<IP>:8084/rest`, where

- "http" is the protocol
- "x" is the user. Authentification in OpenEMS is via password only, so username can be anything.
- "<PASSWORD>" is the user password. If no specifi settings have been made, try 'user' or 'admin' here.
- "8084" is the configured port

A good way to test REST-Api calls is via the Chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/restlet-client-rest-api-t/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm[Restlet]

Api-Endpoints:

- `/channel/<ThingId>/<ChannelName>`
+
Provides access to a channel value. Example: use a GET request to http://x:user@localhost:8084/rest/_sum/EssSoC to get the current average state of charge.

=== Api Websocket Controller

Server for connection from OpenEMS UI to OpenEMS Edge.

=== Channel-Threshold Controller

Switch I/Os according to Channel-Value, e.g. State-of-Charge of the battery.

=== Debug Detailed-Log Controller

Output detailed debug information about specific Components on the console.

=== Debug Log Controller

Output generic information about every Component on every cycle.

=== Ess Limit Total Discharge

Avoid total discharge of an energy storage system (ESS). Allows to define a Min-SoC and Force-Charge-SoC.

=== Symmetric Balancing Controller

Symmetric self-consumption optimization.

=== Symmetric Fix-Active-Power Controller

Allows setting of a fixed Active-Power value for an ESS.

=== Symmetric Fix-Reactive-Power Controller

Allows setting of a fixed Reactive-Power value for an ESS.
