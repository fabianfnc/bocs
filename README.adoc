This is the playbook project for the Antora demonstration site.

To generate the demo site using this playbook project and the demo documentation components, you'll need to {uri-docs-install}[install the Antora CLI and default site generator].

== Playbook

An {uri-docs-playbook}[Antora playbook] is responsible for generating a documentation site.
It contains the instructions a user wants to relay to an Antora site generator pipeline.
These instructions include the content Antora should collect and the UI it should apply to the generated site.

The file [.path]_site.yml_ in this repository is the playbook used to produce the demo site.
It tells Antora where to find the Component A and Component B remote content repositories and default UI.

== Generate the Demo Site

Once you've installed Antora and {uri-demo-playbook}[saved the demo playbook] ([.path]_site.yml_) to a local directory, you're ready to {uri-docs-run}[run Antora].
